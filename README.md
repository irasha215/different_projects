Hi everyine! 

Now I'm intensively learning to code and interested in Data Analysis. This repository contains various side projects I did during test items and just for fun

## List of projects:

[netflix_visualisation](https://github.com/irasha215/different_projects/tree/main/netflix_visulalisation) -- attempt to analyse netflix subscriprion fee in defferent countries. (EDA and visualisation)

[calculating_ltv_romi](https://github.com/irasha215/different_projects/tree/main/calculating_ltv_romi) -- calculating marketing metrics(LTV, ROMI, Retention) of the app and finding problematic areas.
